Notes on drivers:

MPU9150.c:
- To ensure that all the values from the main IMU module
  is from the same sampling instant, use a burst read
  to get the values. The function for this is imu_get_acc_gyr_temp_measurements.

- You must call imu_take_magnet_measurement() before imu_get_magnet_measurement,
  otherwise the magnetometer measurements do not update.
  
- To ensure that the magnetometer measurements are ready to be read, call
  imu_wait_magnet_measurement. This function delays until magnetometer
  measurements are ready.
  
- imu_check_magnet_measurement() returns 1 when magnetometer data is ready,
  0 when it isn't

- To get all the values from the same sampling instant, you can call
  imu_take_magnet_measurement();
  imu_get_acc_gyr_temp_measurements(uint8_t* buffer);
  imu_wait_magnet_measurement();
  imu_get_magnet_measurement(uint8_t* buffer);
  in this order.
  
radio.c
- LQI cannot be obtained directly from a register.
