Hard-iron calibration:
1) Run magnetometer_calibration.py, writing to a log file, while the chip is running.
2) Rotate the chip to get every possible orientation.
3) Run mag_calib.m on the log file generated by magnetometer_calibration.py. The center of the sphere is the hard-iron offset of the magnetometer calibration.
